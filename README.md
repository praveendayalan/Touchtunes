STEPS TO FOLLOW FOR RUNNING THE SCRIPT:
1. Make sure you run the appium server manullay(I tried to start the appium server AppiumDriverLocalService class, My laptop has memory problems so couldn't include it)
2. Create your own emulator in the android studio and start the emulator
3. Make sure you add your emulator name in the config.properties file under the Key "emulatorName". config.properties file is located under the Resources folder.
4. Now, clone the repository from git and run the command "Mvn clean install" to run the script.

THINGS WHICH I CAN IMPROVE:
1. Making the appium server start automatically 
2. Creating a .bat or .sh file to start the emulator without any manual intervention. 
3. creating a .bat or .sh file to run the command mvn clean install
